# mysensors.3dshapes

This project contains 3d mockups for various MySensors components (or 3rd
party components used by Mysensors) used in KiCad, to model a 3d view of the
final PCB layout.

To use these files, they should be placed in your packages3d directory, as
follows

<kicad base dir>/modules/packages3d/mysensors.3dshapes

(on arch linux this is placed in /usr/share/kicad/modules/packages3d)
(on Windows this is placed by default in C:\Program Files\KiCad\share\kicad\modules\packages3d)
